**Ok, Sprint 5 was successful and I even have tested the code by testing the preview server. The summry was also presented by windsurf for sprint 5. So, please read it and then abosrb the progress. After that, since we just made the UI and stuff for mobile devices. It makes sense that we enhance the gameplay and make it enjoyable experience for users who will play this game on their mobile devices. I am thinking that we need to just focus on the touch controls of the game such as the movement and the fire controls. I am thinking, maybe users can move their ship when the user clicks on the screen anywhere on mobile devices and then if they scroll to the right side, the ship immediately moves in that direction and the speed of the movement to that side must be perfect as well, if user scrolls to the right fast, then ship moves fast in the right direction and the similar stuff happens for the left direction. In short words, the users taps on the screem and then doesnt remove his finger and then scroll to the right or the left side so that the shop moves. For this to happen you need to research on the perfect controls and stuff like that for game like these for mobile devices and then craft a perefct sprint 6 prompt for windsurf, which will implement the things that you will research about using Perplexity, Tavily, Firecrawl MCP servers using the tools available with these MCP servers as of 20th October, 2025 and then ensuring that all is perfect. We need to also ensure that the gameplay for desktop that we have as of now is still the same when windsurf is done will all the implementation as per your well reserached sprint 6 ticket prompt for windsurf that you will give. The summary for sprint 5 implementaion by windsurf is as follows:**

Changes Implemented (Sprint 5)
[Scale mode switched to RESIZE]
Updated src/main.ts to use Phaser.Scale.RESIZE and NO_CENTER so the canvas fills the parent.
File: src/main.ts
[Dynamic scaling logic (portrait/landscape)]
Added src/systems/ScaleManager.ts with:
computeScale() to compute zoom and dynamic world size.
applyScale() to apply camera zoom and physics world bounds.
File: src/systems/ScaleManager.ts
[Game scene: resize, world bounds, spawns, bullets]
Import and apply dynamic scaling in create() and on window resize.
Camera zoom fits width in portrait and height in landscape.
Physics world bounds updated to match the visible area.
Background starfields stretched to world bounds.
Enemy/power-up spawns use dynamic world width.
Bullet culling uses dynamic world bounds (no magic 800x600).
File: src/scenes/Game.ts
applyScale(...) used in create()
this.scale.on('resize', this.handleResize, this)
New method: handleResize(...)
Updated spawns in spawnEnemy() and spawnPowerUp()
Updated culling in update() and updateBossBullets()
[Responsive UI layer and anchoring]
UI is already in a separate UI scene, inherently decoupled from the Game camera (acts as a static HUD camera).
UI anchors updated on resize:
Score: top-left
Settings + Mute: top-right
PAUSED: centered
Boss HP bar: centered at top
File: src/scenes/UI.ts
New layoutUI(width, height) called initially and on this.scale.on('resize', ...)
[Mobile virtual joystick + touch-only firing]
Lightweight joystick added in UI (touch devices only):
Appears bottom-left, emits movement vector to Game via events.emit('joystickMove', ...)
Game scene consumes joystick vector for movement. On touch, firing is restricted to the right half of the screen; on desktop, click anywhere.
Files:
src/scenes/UI.ts: setupJoystick(), updateJoystick(...), joystickMove event
src/scenes/Game.ts: listens to joystickMove, integrates movement vector, updates pointer firing logic
[Container fills viewport]
Ensured #game container and page fill the viewport so RESIZE can use full screen.
File: index.html
How It Works
Portrait (tall screens): zoom = viewWidth / 800, so the game fits width and extends height. Physics/world/camera bounds expand vertically.
Landscape (wide screens): zoom = viewHeight / 600, so the game fits height and extends width. Physics/world/camera bounds expand horizontally.
UI stability: Because UI is in its own scene, it is unaffected by the Game camera zoom. It re-anchors on resize to remain usable and legible.
Mobile controls: On touch devices (this.sys.game.device.input.touch):
A joystick appears bottom-left. Moving it sends a normalized vector to Game.
Firing is a tap on the right half. Desktop still fires anywhere.

Verification Checklist (Acceptance Criteria)
[Mobile fill screen] Portrait view (e.g., 375x667) fills the screen vertically with no black bars due to RESIZE and width-fit zoom, plus viewport-filling container in index.html.
[Desktop fill width] 1920x1080 uses height-fit zoom, expanding horizontal view.
[Responsive HUD] Score, buttons, and PAUSED anchor to corners/center via layoutUI() in UI.ts. Font sizes remain readable.
[Mobile joystick] Joystick appears on touch devices, controls movement. Hidden on desktop. Firing is right-half tap on touch, anywhere on desktop.
[Gameplay fairness] Spawns and bullet culling use dynamic world bounds. Enemies enter from just above the top. Projectiles are destroyed outside the visible area. Boss movement bounds adapt to world width.
