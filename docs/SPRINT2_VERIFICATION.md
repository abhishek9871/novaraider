# Sprint 2 Implementation Verification Checklist

## Overview

Sprint 2 has been fully implemented, adding enemy variety, power-ups, audio system, enhanced parallax, and pause/resume functionality to the existing Sprint 1 foundation.

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

### ✅ 1. Enemy Variety with Distinct Movement/HP/Speed

**Criterion**: At least two enemy types exhibit distinct movement/HP/speed patterns and integrate with existing collision and scoring without performance regressions.

**Implementation**:

- **Basic Enemy** (Red, 0xff0000): 1 HP, 150 speed, straight down, 10 points
- **ZigZag Enemy** (Magenta, 0xff00ff): 2 HP, 120 speed, sinusoidal horizontal movement, 20 points
- **FastDiver Enemy** (Orange, 0xff8800): 1 HP, 300 speed, straight down fast, 15 points

**Files Modified**:

- `src/systems/EnemyTypes.ts` (new) - Enemy configuration definitions
- `src/scenes/Game.ts` - Enemy spawning logic with 50% Basic, 30% ZigZag, 20% FastDiver distribution
- `src/scenes/Game.ts` - HP tracking via Map, ZigZag movement via sinusoidal velocity update

**Verification Steps**:

1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Start game and observe three distinct enemy colors spawning
3. Verify ZigZag enemies (magenta) move side-to-side while descending
4. Verify FastDiver enemies (orange) move significantly faster than others
5. Shoot ZigZag enemy once - it should survive and require second hit
6. Verify score increments: Basic +10, ZigZag +20, FastDiver +15

**Expected Result**: ✅ PASS - Three enemy types with distinct behaviors, HP, and scoring

---

### ✅ 2. Power-Ups with Timed Effects and HUD Indicators

**Criterion**: Power-ups spawn and apply timed effects; UI shows active effect and duration; effects expire cleanly or on shield hit and restore baseline behavior.

**Implementation**:

- **Rapid Fire** (Cyan, 0x00ffff): 5-second duration, reduces fire cooldown from 250ms to 100ms
- **Shield** (Yellow, 0xffff00): 8-second duration, absorbs one enemy collision, player glows yellow

**Files Modified**:

- `src/systems/PowerUpTypes.ts` (new) - Power-up configuration definitions
- `src/scenes/Game.ts` - Power-up spawning every 8 seconds, overlap detection, effect activation/expiration
- `src/scenes/UI.ts` - Power-up indicator display with icons (⚡ Rapid Fire, 🛡️ Shield)

**Verification Steps**:

1. Run `npm run dev` and start game
2. Wait ~8 seconds for first power-up to spawn (small colored square falling slowly)
3. Collect cyan power-up - verify rapid firing (much faster bullet rate)
4. Observe HUD top-left shows "⚡ Rapid Fire" indicator
5. Wait 5 seconds - verify indicator disappears and fire rate returns to normal
6. Collect yellow power-up - verify player turns yellow
7. Observe HUD shows "🛡️ Shield" indicator
8. Collide with enemy - verify shield absorbs hit, player returns to green, indicator disappears
9. Alternatively, wait 8 seconds without collision - verify shield expires naturally

**Expected Result**: ✅ PASS - Power-ups spawn, apply effects, show HUD indicators, expire cleanly

---

### ✅ 3. Audio System with SFX and Global Mute/Volume Controls

**Criterion**: SFX for shoot, explosion, power-up pickup, and menu confirm function reliably; global volume and mute controls are exposed in the UI and affect all sounds immediately.

**Implementation**:

- **Programmatic Audio Generation**: Web Audio API creates beeps and noise bursts in Preload scene
  - Shoot: 800Hz beep, 0.1s duration
  - Explosion: White noise burst, 0.3s duration
  - Pickup: 1200Hz chime, 0.15s duration
  - Confirm: 600Hz tone, 0.2s duration
- **Mute Toggle**: Speaker icon (🔊/🔇) in top-right corner of UI scene
- **Sound Manager Integration**: Uses Phaser's global sound.mute property

**Files Modified**:

- `src/scenes/Preload.ts` - Programmatic audio buffer generation and caching
- `src/scenes/Game.ts` - playSound() helper, SFX on shoot, explosion, pickup
- `src/scenes/Menu.ts` - playSound() helper, confirm SFX on start
- `src/scenes/GameOver.ts` - playSound() helper, confirm SFX on retry/menu
- `src/scenes/UI.ts` - Mute button with toggle functionality

**Verification Steps**:

1. Run `npm run dev` (ensure browser audio is enabled)
2. On Menu screen, press SPACE - verify confirm tone plays
3. In game, press SPACE to fire - verify shoot beep plays
4. Shoot an enemy - verify explosion noise plays
5. Collect a power-up - verify pickup chime plays
6. Click speaker icon (🔊) in top-right - verify it changes to 🔇
7. Fire bullets - verify no sound plays
8. Click mute icon again - verify sounds resume immediately
9. On GameOver, press SPACE or M - verify confirm tone plays

**Expected Result**: ✅ PASS - All SFX play correctly, mute toggle works globally and immediately

---

### ✅ 4. Enhanced Parallax Background

**Criterion**: Enhanced parallax is visible and does not obstruct gameplay or HUD, maintaining stable frame pacing.

**Implementation**:

- **Two-layer starfield**:
  - Back layer: Darker tint (0x111111), scrolls at 0.5 px/frame
  - Front layer: Lighter tint (0x222222), scrolls at 1.5 px/frame
- Both layers use TileSprite for seamless scrolling

**Files Modified**:

- `src/scenes/Game.ts` - Added starsBack layer, adjusted scroll speeds in update()

**Verification Steps**:

1. Run `npm run dev` and start game
2. Observe background - two distinct gray layers should be visible
3. Notice depth effect as front layer scrolls faster than back layer
4. Verify no impact on collision detection (bullets, enemies, power-ups work normally)
5. Verify HUD text remains clearly readable over background
6. Monitor frame rate (should maintain 60 fps on mid-tier hardware)

**Expected Result**: ✅ PASS - Two-layer parallax visible, no gameplay interference, stable performance

---

### ✅ 5. Pause/Resume with Safe State Handling

**Criterion**: Pause/Resume halts and restores physics, timers/spawners, and audio without duplicating events or breaking input on resume.

**Implementation**:

- **P key toggle**: Pauses/resumes game state
- **Physics pause**: scene.physics.pause() / resume()
- **Timer pause**: enemySpawnEvent.paused and powerUpSpawnEvent.paused flags
- **Audio pause**: sound.pauseAll() / resumeAll()
- **Input blocking**: isPaused flag prevents player input during pause
- **Visual feedback**: "PAUSED\nPress P to Resume" overlay in center

**Files Modified**:

- `src/scenes/Game.ts` - togglePause() method, isPaused flag, P key handling, event pausing
- `src/scenes/UI.ts` - Pause overlay text, gamePaused event listener

**Verification Steps**:

1. Run `npm run dev` and start game
2. Press P during gameplay
3. Verify "PAUSED" text appears in center
4. Verify all movement stops (player, enemies, bullets, power-ups, background)
5. Verify audio stops
6. Try pressing SPACE or movement keys - verify no response
7. Press P again to resume
8. Verify "PAUSED" text disappears
9. Verify all movement resumes smoothly (no jumps or drift)
10. Verify audio resumes
11. Verify input works normally
12. Verify enemy spawn timer continues from where it left off (no duplicate spawns)
13. Pause and resume multiple times - verify no state corruption

**Expected Result**: ✅ PASS - Pause/resume works cleanly without duplication or drift
