# Sprint 3 Implementation Summary

## Completed Features

### 1. Visual Polish: Explosion Animations and Damage Feedback ✅

**Implementation:**

- Added `createExplosion()` method in Game.ts using Phaser particle emitters
- Particles emit 12 projectiles with red/orange/yellow tints, 400ms lifespan
- Added `createDamageFeedback()` for multi-HP enemies (alpha flash tween)
- Added `createShieldHitFeedback()` for shield collisions (scale tween)
- Explosions trigger on enemy death and player death

**Files Modified:**

- `src/scenes/Game.ts`: Added animation methods and integrated into collision handlers

**Verification:**

- Shoot enemies to see particle explosions
- Hit ZIGZAG enemies (2 HP) to see flash feedback
- Collect shield and collide to see scale animation

### 2. Responsive Scaling: ScaleManager FIT with Auto-Centering ✅

**Implementation:**

- Already configured in `src/main.ts` with `Phaser.Scale.FIT` and `Phaser.Scale.CENTER_BOTH`
- Maintains 800x600 aspect ratio across all resolutions
- Auto-centers game canvas in viewport

**Files Verified:**

- `src/main.ts`: Scale configuration confirmed

**Verification:**

- Resize browser window - game scales proportionally
- Test on mobile resolutions via DevTools - aspect preserved

### 3. Settings Menu: Volume and Mute Controls ✅

**Implementation:**

- Added settings button (⚙️) in UI scene
- Created interactive settings panel with:
  - Volume slider (draggable handle, 0-100%)
  - Real-time volume adjustment via `this.sound.volume`
  - Visual percentage display
  - Close button
- Session persistence using `sessionStorage`
- Settings load on scene create and save on change

**Files Modified:**

- `src/scenes/UI.ts`: Added settings panel, volume slider, drag handlers, persistence

**Verification:**

- Click ⚙️ to open settings
- Drag slider to adjust volume immediately
- Settings persist across scene transitions
- Reset on browser close (session-only)

### 4. Unit Tests: Vitest ✅

**Implementation:**

- Created `src/utils/GameUtils.ts` with pure utility functions:
  - `calculateFireCooldown(baseRate, isRapidFire)`
  - `calculateSpawnDelay(baseDelay)`
  - `calculateScore(enemyType)`
  - `canFire(currentTime, lastFired, cooldown)`
- Created `tests/unit/GameUtils.test.ts` with 10 test cases
- Created `vitest.config.ts` for test configuration

**Files Created:**

- `src/utils/GameUtils.ts`
- `tests/unit/GameUtils.test.ts`
- `vitest.config.ts`

**Test Results:**

```
✓ tests/unit/GameUtils.test.ts (10 tests) 4ms
  Test Files  1 passed (1)
  Tests       10 passed (10)
  Duration    609ms
```

### 5. E2E Tests: Playwright ✅

**Implementation:**

- Created `tests/e2e/game.spec.ts` with 4 smoke tests:
  1. Menu → Game → GameOver flow
  2. HUD score display verification
  3. Pause functionality
  4. Settings menu interaction
- Created `playwright.config.ts` for Chromium and WebKit
- Configured webServer to auto-start dev server

**Files Created:**

- `tests/e2e/game.spec.ts`
- `playwright.config.ts`

**Test Coverage:**

- Scene transitions (Menu → Game)
- Keyboard input (Space, arrows, P key)
- HUD elements (score text, pause overlay)
- Settings button interaction

**Run Instructions:**

```bash
npx playwright install  # First time only
npm run e2e
```

### 6. Documentation ✅

**Files Created/Updated:**

- `SPRINT3_VERIFICATION.md`: Step-by-step verification guide
- `SPRINT3_SUMMARY.md`: This file
- `README.md`: Updated with Sprint 3 features, testing instructions, project structure

## Known Limitations

1. **Settings Persistence**: Session-only (no localStorage/cookies)
2. **Volume Slider**: Mouse-only (no keyboard control)
3. **E2E Timeouts**: Fixed delays may need adjustment on slow systems
4. **Particle Textures**: Uses graphics primitives (no sprite textures)

## Next Steps (Sprint 4)

As per PRD:

- Boss encounters with telegraphed attacks
- Difficulty progression (speed/spawn rate increase)
- Expanded E2E tests for boss mechanics
- Production build optimization
- Best run metrics and summary screen

## Quick Start

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Unit Tests
npm run test

# E2E Tests (install browsers first)
npx playwright install
npm run e2e

# Build
npm run build
npm run preview
```
