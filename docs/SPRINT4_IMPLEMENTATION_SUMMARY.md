# Sprint 4 Implementation Summary

## Overview

Sprint 4 has been fully implemented according to the PRD specifications. This sprint adds boss encounters, difficulty progression, comprehensive UI polish, extended test coverage, and production build verification.

## Implementation Checklist

### ✅ Boss System
- [x] Created `BossConfig.ts` with boss parameters (50 HP, 100 speed, 500 score, 0xff0088 tint)
- [x] Boss spawns deterministically at score ≥ 200 OR time ≥ 90 seconds
- [x] Horizontal sweep movement pattern with direction reversal at boundaries
- [x] Telegraphed burst-fire attack: 5 bullets in spread pattern every 2 seconds
- [x] Dedicated `bossBullets` Arcade Physics Group for clean collision handling
- [x] Boss-player collision triggers death or shield absorption
- [x] Boss-bullet collision reduces HP with visual feedback (alpha flash)
- [x] Boss defeat triggers particle explosion and victory screen
- [x] 500 point bonus awarded on boss defeat

### ✅ Difficulty Progression
- [x] `calculateEnemySpeed()` function scales speed up to 1.5x over 60 seconds
- [x] `calculateSpawnDelay()` function reduces spawn delay from 1500ms to 800ms minimum
- [x] Progression applied to all enemy types on spawn
- [x] Safe bounds prevent runaway difficulty or performance issues
- [x] Wave spawning pauses during boss encounter
- [x] Power-up spawning pauses during boss encounter
- [x] Progression continues in background but doesn't affect boss

### ✅ UI Enhancements
- [x] Boss health bar displays at top center on boss spawn
- [x] Health bar shows "BOSS: X/50" text with visual bar
- [x] Health bar updates in real-time with each hit
- [x] Health bar uses pink fill (0xff0088) matching boss color
- [x] Health bar disappears on boss defeat
- [x] GameOver scene updated to show comprehensive run summary
- [x] Summary displays: Final Score, Time Survived, Enemies Destroyed, Power-Ups Collected
- [x] Victory screen shows "VICTORY!" in green with "Boss Defeated!" message
- [x] Defeat screen shows "GAME OVER" in red with standard summary

### ✅ Game Metrics Tracking
- [x] `gameStartTime` tracks session start time
- [x] `enemiesDestroyed` counter increments on each kill
- [x] `powerUpsCollected` counter increments on each collection

- [x] All metrics passed to GameOver scene via scene data

### ✅ Audio and Visual Feedback
- [x] Boss spawn plays confirmation sound (reuses 'confirm')
- [x] Boss firing plays shoot sound (reuses 'shoot')
- [x] Boss damage plays explosion sound (reuses 'explosion')
- [x] Boss defeat triggers particle explosion (12 particles, red/orange/yellow)
- [x] Boss damage shows alpha flash feedback
- [x] No new audio assets required (uses existing programmatic generation)

## Key Implementation Details

### Boss Spawn Logic
```typescript
// In Game.ts update()
const elapsed = time - this.gameStartTime;
if (!this.bossActive && shouldSpawnBoss(this.score, elapsed)) {
  this.spawnBoss();
}
```

### Difficulty Progression
```typescript
// In GameUtils.ts
export function calculateEnemySpeed(baseSpeed: number, elapsedTime: number = 0): number {
  const progressionFactor = Math.min(elapsedTime / 60000, 1);
  const maxSpeedMultiplier = 1.5;
  return baseSpeed * (1 + progressionFactor * (maxSpeedMultiplier - 1));
}
```

### Boss Health Bar
```typescript
// In UI.ts
private updateBossHealthBar(hp: number, maxHp: number) {
  const healthPercent = hp / maxHp;
  const currentWidth = barWidth * healthPercent;
  this.bossHealthBar.fillRect(x, y, currentWidth, barHeight);
  this.bossHealthText.setText(`BOSS: ${hp}/${maxHp}`);
}
```

### Run Summary
```typescript
// In GameOver.ts
create(data: {
  score: number;
  timeSurvived?: number;
  enemiesDestroyed?: number;
  powerUpsCollected?: number;
  victory?: boolean;
})
```

## Testing Results

### Unit Tests
```
✅ 19/19 tests passed
✅ Execution time: <1 second
✅ Coverage: All utility functions
```

### Production Build
```
✅ Build successful
✅ Output: 1.5 MB (345 KB gzipped)
✅ No errors or warnings (except expected chunk size)
```

## Preserved Features

All Sprint 1-3 features remain fully functional with zero regressions:
- Player movement and firing
- Three enemy types (Basic, ZigZag, FastDiver)
- Two power-ups (Rapid Fire, Shield)
- Pause/resume system
- Settings menu with volume control
- Explosion animations
- Damage feedback
- Responsive scaling
- Audio system
- Parallax background

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Boss as Separate Entity**: Boss is not part of enemy groups, allowing independent logic
2. **Dedicated Boss Bullets Group**: Separate from player bullets for clean collision handling
3. **Event-Based UI Updates**: Boss health bar updates via scene events for decoupling
4. **Metrics in Scene Data**: Pass all metrics to GameOver via scene.start() data parameter
5. **Progression Functions in Utils**: Pure functions for testability and reusability
6. **Safe Progression Caps**: Minimum spawn delay and maximum speed multiplier prevent issues

## Performance Considerations

- Boss bullets limited to 50 max (Group maxSize)
- Difficulty progression capped at reasonable values
- Boss spawning pauses regular waves to prevent overwhelming player
- Particle effects use same lightweight system as Sprint 3
- No additional asset loading required

## Browser Compatibility

Tested and verified on:
- ✅ Chromium (E2E tests)
- ✅ WebKit (E2E tests)
- ✅ Expected to work on Firefox (Phaser 3 supports all modern browsers)

## Deployment Ready

The game is production-ready and can be deployed to:
- Static hosting services (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)
- CDN distribution
- Electron wrapper for desktop
- Cordova/Capacitor for mobile

## How to Verify

1. **Run Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Play until score reaches 200 or 90 seconds to trigger boss

2. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   npm run test    # Unit tests
   npm run e2e     # E2E tests
   ```

3. **Build and Preview**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```
   Navigate to http://localhost:4173

4. **Follow Verification Guide**:
   See `SPRINT4_VERIFICATION.md` for detailed step-by-step verification

## Conclusion

The implementation follows the PRD specifications exactly, maintains all existing features without regressions, and uses the pinned versions of all dependencies (Node 22.12+, Vite 7.1.10, TypeScript 5.9.3, Phaser 3.90.0, Vitest 3.2.4, Playwright 1.55.0).
