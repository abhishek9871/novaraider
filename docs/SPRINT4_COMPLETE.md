# Sprint 4 Implementation Complete

## Summary

Sprint 4 has been successfully implemented with all acceptance criteria met. The game now features a complete boss encounter system, difficulty progression, comprehensive UI polish, extended test coverage, and a production-ready build.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Boss System (`src/systems/BossConfig.ts`, `src/scenes/Game.ts`)

- **Boss Configuration**: 50 HP, pink/magenta color (0xff0088), 100 px/s horizontal speed
- **Spawn Condition**: Deterministic trigger at score ≥ 200 OR elapsed time ≥ 90 seconds
- **Movement Pattern**: Horizontal sweep across top of screen, reverses direction at boundaries
- **Attack Pattern**: Telegraphed burst-fire every 2 seconds, 5 bullets in spread formation
- **Boss Bullets Group**: Dedicated Arcade Physics Group for clean collision handling
- **Collision Detection**: Overlaps with player bullets (damage), player ship (death/shield), boss bullets vs player
- **Defeat Sequence**: Particle explosion, 500 point bonus, victory screen transition

### 2. Difficulty Progression (`src/utils/GameUtils.ts`)

- **Enemy Speed Scaling**: `calculateEnemySpeed()` increases speed up to 1.5x over 60 seconds
- **Spawn Rate Scaling**: `calculateSpawnDelay()` decreases delay from 1500ms to 800ms minimum
- **Safe Bounds**: Progression capped to prevent performance issues or unfair difficulty
- **Boss Pause**: Wave spawning and power-up spawning pause during boss encounter
- **Observable Progression**: Players can clearly see enemies getting faster and more frequent

### 3. UI Enhancements (`src/scenes/UI.ts`, `src/scenes/GameOver.ts`)

- **Boss Health Bar**: Real-time HP display at top center with visual bar and text "BOSS: X/50"
- **Health Bar Styling**: Pink fill (0xff0088), white border, 400px width, updates on each hit
- **Run Summary Screen**: Comprehensive metrics on GameOver/Victory
  - Final Score
  - Time Survived (seconds)
  - Enemies Destroyed (count)
  - Power-Ups Collected (count)
- **Victory vs Defeat**: Different colors and messages (green "VICTORY!" vs red "GAME OVER")
- **Boss Defeated Message**: Special message on victory screen

### 4. Game Metrics Tracking (`src/scenes/Game.ts`)

- **Time Tracking**: `gameStartTime` records start, calculates elapsed time on death/victory
- **Enemy Counter**: `enemiesDestroyed` increments on each enemy kill (including boss)
- **Power-Up Counter**: `powerUpsCollected` increments on each power-up collection
- **Data Passing**: All metrics passed to GameOver scene via scene data

### 5. Extended Unit Tests (`tests/unit/GameUtils.test.ts`)

- **Total Tests**: 19 tests (up from 12)
- **New Tests**:
  - `calculateSpawnDelay` with progression (3 tests)
  - `calculateEnemySpeed` with progression (3 tests)
  - `shouldSpawnBoss` trigger conditions (3 tests)
  - Updated `calculateScore` to include BOSS type
- **Test Coverage**: All utility functions including progression logic
- **Performance**: All tests pass in <1 second

### 6. Extended E2E Tests (`tests/e2e/game.spec.ts`)

- **Total Tests**: 7 tests (up from 4)
- **New Tests**:
  - Boss health bar appearance on spawn
  - Victory screen after boss defeat
  - Run summary with all metrics
- **Browser Coverage**: Chromium and WebKit
- **Test Approach**: Uses page.evaluate() to manipulate game state for deterministic testing

### 7. Documentation

- **SPRINT4_VERIFICATION.md**: Comprehensive step-by-step verification guide with 8 sections
- **README.md**: Updated with Sprint 4 features, controls, and acceptance criteria
- **Project Structure**: Updated to include BossConfig.ts

## Technical Implementation Details

### Boss Lifecycle

1. **Spawn Check**: Every frame checks `shouldSpawnBoss(score, elapsed)`
2. **Spawn**: Creates boss sprite, pauses wave spawning, emits `bossSpawned` event
3. **Update Loop**: Horizontal movement, direction reversal, periodic firing
4. **Damage**: Bullet overlap reduces HP, emits `bossHpUpdate` event, alpha flash feedback
5. **Defeat**: HP reaches 0, explosion particles, score bonus, victory screen

### Difficulty Progression

- **Update Frequency**: Every 100ms via timed event
- **Calculation**: Linear interpolation from base to max over 60 seconds
- **Application**: Applied to spawn delay and enemy speed on creation
- **Boss Pause**: Progression continues but spawning pauses during boss

### Audio Integration

- **Boss Spawn**: Reuses 'confirm' sound (600Hz tone)
- **Boss Fire**: Reuses 'shoot' sound (800Hz beep)
- **Boss Hit**: Reuses 'explosion' sound (noise burst)
- **No New Assets**: All audio uses existing programmatic generation

### Scene Communication

- **Game → UI Events**:
  - `bossSpawned` with HP data
  - `bossHpUpdate` with current HP
  - `bossDefeated` to hide health bar
- **Game → GameOver Data**:
  - `score`, `timeSurvived`, `enemiesDestroyed`, `powerUpsCollected`, `victory`

## Verification Results

## Acceptance Criteria Status

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Boss spawns deterministically | ✅ PASS | Score ≥ 200 or time ≥ 90s |
| Boss exhibits telegraphed attacks | ✅ PASS | Burst-fire pattern, 5 bullets |
| Boss takes multiple hits | ✅ PASS | 50 HP, visual feedback |
| Boss defeat triggers win sequence | ✅ PASS | Victory screen with summary |
| Difficulty ramp observable | ✅ PASS | Speed/spawn rate increase |
| Difficulty ramp bounded | ✅ PASS | Safe caps at 1.5x speed, 800ms delay |
| Wave spawning pauses during boss | ✅ PASS | Enemies/power-ups pause |
| Boss health bar displays | ✅ PASS | Real-time HP updates |
| Run summary shows metrics | ✅ PASS | Score, time, enemies, power-ups |
| Unit tests pass | ✅ PASS | 19 tests, <1s execution |
| E2E tests pass | ✅ PASS | 7 tests, Chromium + WebKit |
| Production build succeeds | ✅ PASS | No errors, optimized output |

## Known Limitations

- Boss spawn is one-time per session (no loop after victory)
- Boss bullets use simple spread pattern (not homing or complex)
- Difficulty progression is linear (not exponential)
- E2E tests use page.evaluate() for state manipulation (not pure user simulation)

These limitations are acceptable per PRD Sprint 4 scope.

## Conclusion

Sprint 4 is **COMPLETE** and **PRODUCTION READY**. All acceptance criteria met, all tests passing, no regressions. The game now features a complete gameplay arc from menu through progressive difficulty to boss encounter and victory/defeat.
