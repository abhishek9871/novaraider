Run unit tests for utility functions:

```bash
npm run test
```

Tests cover:

- Fire cooldown calculations (base rate vs rapid fire)
- Spawn delay logic with difficulty progression
- Enemy speed scaling with difficulty progression
- Score calculations for enemy types (including boss)
- Fire timing validation
- Boss spawn condition logic

### E2E Tests (Playwright)

Install browsers (first time only):

```bash
npx playwright install
```

Run end-to-end smoke tests:

```bash
npm run e2e
```

Tests verify:

- Menu ‚Üí Game ‚Üí GameOver flow
- HUD score display
- Pause/resume functionality
- Settings menu interaction
- Boss health bar appearance
- Victory screen with boss defeat
- Run summary with all metrics

Tests run on Chromium and WebKit. HTML report generated in `playwright-report/`.

## Production Ready

All four sprints completed:
- ‚úÖ Sprint 1: Core gameplay loop
- ‚úÖ Sprint 2: Enemy variety, power-ups, audio
- ‚úÖ Sprint 3: Polish, responsiveness, tests
- ‚úÖ Sprint 4: Boss encounters, difficulty progression, final QA

The game is production-ready and can be deployed to any static hosting service.
